Note from the developer of the mod:
This folder only contains the language files for the mod.

For Windows OS (only):
Player configs are now stored inside: %appData%\Wargaming.net\WorldOfTanks\mods\champi\<modname>

For macOS: I don't know yet, maybe you can tell me?

The player config will no longer be overwritten to default when a mod updates comes out without any changes on the
config commands. Instead, the configuration is migrated to the new version while trying to keep the old values. This is
not possible in all cases, but it'll be tried.
